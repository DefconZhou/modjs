## Api

* [file](https://github.com/modulejs/modjs/tree/master/doc/api/file.md) - There are many provided methods for reading and writing files, traversing the filesystem and finding files by matching globbing patterns. Many of these methods are wrappers around built-in Node.js file functionality, but with additional error handling, logging and character encoding normalization.
